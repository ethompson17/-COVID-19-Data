# COVID-19 Data Project

This is my first project about COVID-19

I extracted data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths (file: )
This dataset was last updated Feburary 4th, 2022

I broke the data up into two different tables. One for COVID-19 Deaths, and the other for COVID-19 Vaccinations.

I ran a few different queries, breaking the data down into different categories using SQL:

1. DeathPercentage for each country;
2. PercentOfPopulationInfected by country per day;
3. Highest Infection Rates per country;
4. Countries with Highest Death Count;
5. Total Death count for per Continent and Level of Income
6. World Death DeathPercentage
7. CTE Table and TEMP Table
8. List of created views

I then imported the data into tableau to create a few visualizations. (Link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/elijah.thompson3946/viz/COVID-19Dashboard_16441121646540/Dashboard1)
